# I'm currently not planning on continuing this project



# Three.NET
Three.NET is a C# wrapper of [three.js](https://threejs.org). It utilizes ASP.NET Core's JS Interop to communicate between JavaScript and C#. If you have any ideas about optimizations or other improvements, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/JonathanBout/Three.NET/issues/new/choose)ðŸ™‚

Be aware that this is a project I do next to my other daily activities, so development is not going very fast.
